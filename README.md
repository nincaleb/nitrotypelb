# NitroType Season Leaderboards

This repository contains two main components:

1. **Python Script:**  
   A script (`nitrotype_leaderboard.py`) to fetch seasonal statistics from the NitroType API for a predefined list of team tags. It processes player data to calculate additional metrics (like accuracy and speed) and generates two CSV files:
   - A player leaderboard sorted by Points (highest first).
   - A team leaderboard that aggregates points for each team.
   
2. **HTML Pages:**  
   Two dark-themed webpages that display the leaderboards interactively using DataTables and PapaParse:
   - `index.html` – Displays the **Player Leaderboard**.
   - `teams.html` – Displays the **Team Leaderboard**.
   
   Both pages dynamically display a **Last Updated** timestamp, fetched from a `timestamp.txt` file that is generated by the Python script. Additionally, each page includes a prominent Google Form link at the top for requesting a team to be added to the leaderboard.

## Features

### Python Script

- **Data Fetching:**  
  Uses the NitroType API to obtain seasonal data for each team in a predefined list (`TEAM_TAGS`).

- **Calculations:**  
  - **Accuracy:** Calculated as `(typed - errs) / typed`.
  - **Speed (WPM):** Computed using the formula `(((points / races) / accuracy) - 100) * 2`.

- **CSV Generation:**  
  Produces two CSV files with the current date (formatted as `YYYYMMDD`):
  - `nitrotype_season_leaderboard_YYYYMMDD.csv`
  - `nitrotype_team_leaderboard_YYYYMMDD.csv`

- **Team Aggregation:**  
  Sums points, counts racers, and totals races for each team.

- **Timestamp Generation:**  
  Writes a `timestamp.txt` file with the exact date and time (`Last Updated: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`) each time the script is run. The HTML pages use this file to display the **Last Updated** timestamp.

### HTML Pages

- **Dynamic Timestamp Display:**  
  Both `index.html` and `teams.html` fetch and display the **Last Updated** timestamp generated by the Python script from `timestamp.txt`.

- **Dynamic Data Loading:**  
  The pages use PapaParse to load CSV files dynamically and DataTables to offer search, sort (with default descending order on all sortable columns), and pagination functionality.

- **Dark Theme:**  
  Custom CSS ensures that all components—including table cells (even on selection and sorting)—adhere to a dark style.

- **Google Form Integration:**  
  Each page features a link at the top allowing users to request that a new team be added to the leaderboard.

## File Structure

- `README.md` – This file.
- `nitrotype_leaderboard.py` – Python script for fetching and processing NitroType data.
- `index.html` – Player leaderboard webpage.
- `teams.html` – Team leaderboard webpage.
- `timestamp.txt` – File dynamically generated by the Python script to store the last updated timestamp.
- CSV files (generated dynamically, e.g., `nitrotype_season_leaderboard_YYYYMMDD.csv` and `nitrotype_team_leaderboard_YYYYMMDD.csv`).

## Prerequisites and Setup

### For the Python Script

1. **Dependencies:**  
   Ensure you have Python 3.6 or higher and install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install requests pandas
   ```

2. **Configuration:**  
   - The script uses a predefined list of team tags in the `TEAM_TAGS` variable. Adjust this list as needed.
   - Helper functions within the script calculate accuracy and speed from the API data.

3. **Running the Script:**  
   Execute the script to generate the CSV files and `timestamp.txt`:
   ```bash
   python nitrotype_leaderboard.py
   ```
   The CSV files and timestamp will be created in the repository’s root directory.

### For the HTML Pages

1. **CSV Files:**  
   Ensure that the generated CSV files are present in the same directory as `index.html` and `teams.html`.

2. **Local Testing:**  
   For best results, run a local web server (this avoids issues with file URL restrictions). For example, using Python’s built-in HTTP server:
   ```bash
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```
   Then visit:
   - [http://localhost:8000/index.html](http://localhost:8000/index.html) for the player leaderboard.
   - [http://localhost:8000/teams.html](http://localhost:8000/teams.html) for the team leaderboard.

3. **Customization:**  
   - Adjust the embedded CSS in the `<style>` sections of the HTML files to change the appearance (such as dark mode colors, fonts, etc.).
   - Modify the Google Form URL in the `.request-link` sections if you’re using a different form.

## Customization Options

- **Team Tags and Data Calculations:**  
  Modify the `TEAM_TAGS` variable and helper functions (`calculate_accuracy`, `calculate_speed`) in `nitrotype_leaderboard.py` as needed.

- **HTML Styling and Features:**  
  Both HTML pages feature embedded CSS for dark mode styling. Adjust the styles or DataTables configuration (e.g., modifying the default sort order or appearance) to suit your preferences.

- **Timestamp Display:**  
  Ensure `timestamp.txt` is updated whenever the Python script runs. The HTML pages will fetch and display this timestamp automatically.

- **Google Form:**  
  The Google Form link appears at the top of each page. You can update this link by changing the URL in the corresponding HTML files.
